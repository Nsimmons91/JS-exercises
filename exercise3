// Exercise 1. Write a 'while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).
let number = 1; // Initialize the starting number

while (number <= 5) { // Continue looping while number is less than or equal to 5
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number++; // Increment the number by 1
}

// Exercise 2. Write a 'do while' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

let number = 1; // Initialize the starting number

do {
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number++; // Increment the number by 1
} while (number <= 5); // Continue looping while number is less than or equal to 5

// Exercise 3. Write a 'for' loop that prints the integers (whole numbers)
// between 1 and 5 (inclusive).

for (let number = 1; number <= 5; number++) { // Initialize number to 1, continue while it's less than or equal to 5, and increment by 1
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
}

// Exercise 4. Now we want a loop that prints the integers
// counting DOWN from 10 to 1 (inclusive). Write three loops that do this, to practice
// writing loops in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
let number = 10; // Initialize the starting number

while (number >= 1) { // Continue looping while number is greater than or equal to 1
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number--; // Decrement the number by 1
}

let number = 10; // Initialize the starting number

do {
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number--; // Decrement the number by 1
} while (number >= 1); // Continue looping while number is greater than or equal to 1

for (let number = 10; number >= 1; number--) { // Initialize number to 10, continue while it's greater than or equal to 1, and decrement by 1
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
}


// Exercise 5. Write a loop that prints the integers from 7 to 27. Write this
// loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
let number = 7; // Initialize the starting number

let number = 7; // Initialize the starting number

while (number <= 27) { // Continue looping while number is less than or equal to 27
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number++; // Increment the number by 1
}

do {
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
  number++; // Increment the number by 1
} while (number <= 27); // Continue looping while number is less than or equal to 27

for (let number = 7; number <= 27; number++) { // Initialize number to 7, continue while it's less than or equal to 27, and increment by 1
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
}


// Exercise 6. Write a loop that prints numbers between 0 and 100, counting by tens.
// I.e. it will print 10, then 20, then 30, etc.
// Write this loop in all 3 ways -- as a 'while', 'do while', and 'for' loop.
let number = 0; // Initialize the starting number

while (number <= 100) { // Continue looping while number is less than or equal to 100
  number += 10; // Increment the number by 10
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
}

let number = 0; // Initialize the starting number

do {
  number += 10; // Increment the number by 10
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
} while (number < 100); // Continue looping while number is less than 100

for (let number = 10; number <= 100; number += 10) { // Initialize number to 10, continue while it's less than or equal to 100, and increment by 10
  console.log(number); // Print the current number
}


// Exercise 7. Add a comment as to why the following loop is an infinite loop (will
// run without ever stopping). Then fix the loop so that it stops when
// counterFour is equal to -100.

let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour < 2) {
  console.log("HELP ME!");
  counterFour--;
}


Why the Original Loop is Infinite:
The loop keeps running forever because the condition `counterFour < 2` is always true when `counterFour` starts at 1. Even though `counterFour` goes down by 1 each time, it will never stop being less than 2 because it will keep getting smaller and smaller, leading to endless printing of "HELP ME!".

let counterFour = 1;
while (counterFour > -100) { // Keep looping as long as counterFour is more than -100
  console.log("HELP ME!"); // Print "HELP ME!"
  counterFour--; // Decrease counterFour by 1
}


// Exercise 8. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer. Write a loop
// (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to that number.
let favoriteInteger = 7; // Your favorite integer
let currentNumber = 0; // Start from 0

while (currentNumber <= favoriteInteger) { // Continue looping while currentNumber is less than or equal to favoriteInteger
  console.log(currentNumber); // Print the current number
  currentNumber++; // Increment currentNumber by 1
}


// Exercise 9. Make a variable that contains your favorite integer (this time make sure it's
// less than 100). Write a loop (your choice which type) that prints the integers from 0 to 100.
// Next to each number it should print "not my favorite number". But next to your favorite
// number it should print "my favorite number!". Example output (if your favorite number was 2):
// 0 not my favorite number
// 1 not my favorite number
// 2 my favorite number!
// 3 not my favorite number
// ...
// (Hint - use an if statement in your loop)

let favoriteInteger = 7; // Your favorite integer
let currentNumber = 0; // Start from 0

while (currentNumber <= 100) { // Loop until currentNumber is greater than 100
  if (currentNumber === favoriteInteger) { // Check if currentNumber is the favorite integer
    console.log(currentNumber + ": my favorite number!"); // Print the favorite number message
  } else {
    console.log(currentNumber + ": not my favorite number."); // Print the not favorite number message
  }
  currentNumber++; // Increment currentNumber by 1
}



// Exercise 10. In some of the exercises above, we had you write all 3 types of loops, for practice.
// But in real life, how would you decide which type of loop to use? You might not have an
// exact answer, but spend a few minutes thinking about the different types of loops and/or
// doing some research and write down your thoughts in a comment below:
// 1. For Loop
- When to Use: Use this when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.
- Example: Counting from 1 to 10 or going through each item in a list.
- Why it's Good: It's clear and straightforward when you have a set number of times to loop.

2. While Loop
- When to Use: Use this when you don't know how many times you need to repeat something, and it depends on a condition.
- Example: Keeping asking a user for input until they provide a valid answer or reading data until there's no more left.
- Why it's Good: It's flexible, but you need to be careful to make sure it eventually stops, or you might get stuck in an endless loop.

3. Do While Loop
- When to Use: Use this when you want to make sure the loop runs at least once, even if the condition isn't true right away.
- Example: Asking a user for input and showing a prompt before checking if their input is valid.
- Why it's Good: It guarantees that the code inside the loop will run at least one time.

Quick Tips for Choosing a Loop:
- If you know how many times to loop: Use a for loop.
- If it depends on a condition: Use a while loop.
- If it must run at least once: Use a do while loop.

// Exercise 11. Now we'll practice using nested loops (a loop inside another loop)!
// Update the nested loops below to so that for each value of outsideCounter,
// the inside loop will show a countdown

/*
counting down from 0
*********************************** 
counting down from 1
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 2
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
counting down from 3
inside 3
inside 2
inside 1
*********************************** 
*/

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3 /*???*/; ) {
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter /*???*/ /*???*/; ; ) {
    console.log("inside" /*???*/);
  }
  console.log("***********************************");
}

for (let outsideCounter = 0; outsideCounter <= 3; outsideCounter++) { // Updated to include increment
  console.log("counting down from", outsideCounter);
  
  for (let insideCounter = outsideCounter; insideCounter > 0; insideCounter--) { // Updated initialization and condition
    console.log("inside", insideCounter); // Updated to include the current insideCounter value
  }
  
  console.log("");
}

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
// Once I was able to figure out how to use the loops , it was easier. 
I used google and had ai explain the problems to me as if I was a ten year old.
